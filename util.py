    Extract the last C++ code block from text with the following logic:

    1. First, try to match all fenced code blocks starting with ```cpp at the beginning of a line.
       If found, search from the last one backwards and return the first block containing "#include".

    2. If no suitable fenced code blocks are found, start from the last occurrence of int main( 
       and work backwards with the following process:
         a. From the main occurrence position, find the first left brace '{', then perform 
            brace matching until the matching is complete.
         b. Expand upwards: determine the line where main is located, then scan upwards for 
            consecutive lines starting with "#include", concatenate these lines with the content 
            between them and main to form a candidate code block.
         c. If the candidate code block contains "#include", return that candidate block.

    If none are found, return None.
